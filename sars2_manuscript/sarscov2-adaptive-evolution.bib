  abstract = "Summary The pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 threatens public
              health worldwide. The viral spike protein mediates SARS-CoV-2
              entry into host cells and harbors a S1/S2 cleavage site
              containing multiple arginine residues (multibasic) not found in
              closely related animal coronaviruses. However, the role of this
              multibasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown.
              Here, we report that the cellular protease furin cleaves the
              spike protein at the S1/S2 site and that cleavage is essential
              for S-protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and entry into human lung
              cells. Moreover, optimizing the S1/S2 site increased cell-cell,
              but not virus-cell, fusion, suggesting that the corresponding
              viral variants might exhibit increased cell-cell spread and
              potentially altered virulence. Our results suggest that
              acquisition of a S1/S2 multibasic cleavage site was essential for
              SARS-CoV-2 infection of humans and identify furin as a potential
              target for therapeutic intervention.",

              replacement has not been defined. Here we report that Delta spike
              mutation P681R plays a key role in the Alpha-to-Delta variant
              replacement. In a replication competition assay, Delta SARS-CoV-2
              efficiently outcompeted the Alpha variant in human lung
              epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues. Delta
              SARS-CoV-2 bearing the Alpha-spike glycoprotein replicated less
              efficiently than the wild-type Delta variant, suggesting the
              importance of Delta spike in enhancing viral replication. The
              Delta spike has accumulated mutation P681R located at a furin
              cleavage site that separates the spike 1 (S1) and S2 subunits.
              Reverting the P681R mutation to wild-type P681 significantly
              reduced the replication of Delta variant, to a level lower than
              the Alpha variant. Mechanistically, the Delta P681R mutation
              enhanced the cleavage of the full-length spike to S1 and S2,
              leading to increased infection via cell surface entry. In
              contrast, the Alpha spike also has a mutation at the same amino
              acid (P681H), but the spike cleavage from purified Alpha virions
              was reduced compared to the Delta spike. Collectively, our
              results indicate P681R as a key mutation in enhancing Delta
              variant replication via increased S1/S2 cleavage. Spike mutations
              that potentially affect furin cleavage efficiency must be closely

              identified in COVID-19 cases from a Ugandan prison in July 2020,
              and then was identified in the general population with additional
              spike mutations (R102I, L141F, E484K and P681R) to comprise
              lineage A.23.1 by September 2020-with this virus being designated
              a variant of interest (VOI) in Africa and with subsequent spread
              to 26 other countries. The P681R spike substitution of the A.23.1
              VOI is of note as it increases the number of basic residues in
              the sub-optimal SARS-CoV-2 spike protein furin cleavage site; as
              such, this substitution may affect viral replication,
              transmissibility or pathogenic properties. The same P681R
              substitution has also appeared in B.1.617 variants, including
              B.1.617.2 (Delta). Here, we performed assays using fluorogenic
              peptides mimicking the S1/S2 sequence from A.23.1 and B.1.617.2
              and observed significantly increased cleavability with furin,
              compared to sequences derived from the original Wuhan-Hu1 S1/S2.
              We performed functional infectivity assays using pseudotyped MLV
              particles harboring SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and observed an
              increase in transduction for A.23.1-pseudotyped particles
              compared to Wuhan-Hu-1 in Vero-TMPRSS2 and Calu-3 cells (with a
              presumed ``early'' entry pathway), although lowered infection in
              Vero E6 cells (with a presumed ``late'' entry pathway). However,
              these changes in infectivity were not reproduced in the original
              Wuhan-Hu-1 spike bearing only the P681R substitution. Our
              findings suggest that while A.23.1 has increased furin-mediated
              cleavage linked to the P681R substitution-which may affect viral
              infection and transmissibility-this substitution alone is not
              sufficient and needs to occur on the background of other spike
              protein changes to enable its full functional consequences.",

  abstract = "As shown during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, phylogenetic and
              phylodynamic methods are essential tools to study the spread and
              evolution of pathogens. One of the central assumptions of these
              methods is that the shared history of pathogens isolated from
              different hosts can be described by a branching phylogenetic
              tree. Recombination breaks this assumption. This makes it
              problematic to apply phylogenetic methods to study recombining
              pathogens, including, for example, coronaviruses. Here, we
              introduce a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach that allows
              inference of recombination networks from genetic sequence data
              under a template switching model of recombination. Using this
              method, we first show that recombination is extremely common in
              the evolutionary history of SARS-like coronaviruses. We then show
              how recombination rates across the genome of the human seasonal
              coronaviruses 229E, OC43 and NL63 vary with rates of adaptation.
              This suggests that recombination could be beneficial to fitness
              of human seasonal coronaviruses. Additionally, this work sets the
              stage for Bayesian phylogenetic tracking of the spread and

              concern. In infected cells, the CoV RNA-synthesizing machinery
              associates with modified endoplasmic reticulum membranes that are
              transformed into the viral replication organelle (RO). Although
              double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) appear to be a pan-CoV RO
              element, studies to date describe an assortment of additional
              CoV-induced membrane structures. Despite much speculation, it
              remains unclear which RO element(s) accommodate viral RNA
              synthesis. Here we provide detailed 2D and 3D analyses of CoV ROs

              pandemic by the WHO. We provide here bio-informatic, evolutionary
              analysis of 351 available sequences of its genome with the aim of
              mapping genome structural variations and the patterns of
              selection. METHODS: A Maximum likelihood tree has been built and
              selective pressure has been investigated in order to find any
              mutation developed during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic that could
              potentially affect clinical evolution of the infection. FINDING:
              We have found in more recent isolates the presence of two
              mutations affecting the Non-Structural Protein 6 (NSP6) and the
              Open Reding Frame10 (ORF 10) adjacent regions. Amino acidic
              change stability analysis suggests both mutations could confer
              lower stability of the protein structures. INTERPRETATION: One of
              the two mutations, likely developed within the genome during
              virus spread, could affect virus intracellular survival. Genome
              follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 spread is urgently needed in order to

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The interpandemic evolution of the influenza A virus
              hemagglutinin (HA) protein is commonly considered a paragon of
              rapid evolutionary change under positive selection in which amino
              acid replacements are fixed by virtue of their effect on
              antigenicity, enabling the virus to evade immune surveillance.
              RESULTS: We performed phylogenetic analyses of the recently
              obtained large and relatively unbiased samples of the HA
              sequences from 1995-2005 isolates of the H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes
              of influenza A virus. Unexpectedly, it was found that the
              evolution of H3N2 HA includes long intervals of generally neutral
              sequence evolution without apparent substantial antigenic change
              (``stasis'' periods) that are characterized by an excess of
              synonymous over nonsynonymous substitutions per site, lack of
              association of amino acid replacements with epitope regions, and
              slow extinction of coexisting virus lineages. These long periods
              of stasis are punctuated by shorter intervals of rapid evolution
              under positive selection during which new dominant lineages
              quickly displace previously coexisting ones. The preponderance of
              positive selection during intervals of rapid evolution is
              supported by the dramatic excess of amino acid replacements in
              the epitope regions of HA compared to replacements in the rest of
              the HA molecule. In contrast, the stasis intervals showed a much
              more uniform distribution of replacements over the HA molecule,
              with a statistically significant difference in the rate of
              synonymous over nonsynonymous substitution in the epitope regions
              between the two modes of evolution. A number of parallel amino
              acid replacements - the same amino acid substitution occurring
              independently in different lineages - were also detected in H3N2
              HA. These parallel mutations were, largely, associated with
              periods of rapid fitness change, indicating that there are major
              limitations on evolutionary pathways during antigenic change. The
              finding that stasis is the prevailing modality of H3N2 evolution
              suggests that antigenic changes that lead to an increase in
              fitness typically result from epistatic interactions between
              several amino acid substitutions in the HA and, perhaps, other
              viral proteins. The strains that become dominant due to increased
              fitness emerge from low frequency strains thanks to the last
              amino acid replacement that completes the set of replacements
              required to produce a significant antigenic change; no subset of
              substitutions results in a biologically significant antigenic
              change and corresponding fitness increase. In contrast to H3N2,
              no clear intervals of evolution under positive selection were
              detected for the H1N1 HA during the same time span. Thus, the
              ascendancy of H1N1 in some seasons is, most likely, caused by the
              drop in the relative fitness of the previously prevailing H3N2
              lineages as the fraction of susceptible hosts decreases during
              the stasis intervals. CONCLUSION: We show that the common view of
              the evolution of influenza virus as a rapid, positive
              selection-driven process is, at best, incomplete. Rather, the
              interpandemic evolution of influenza appears to consist of
              extended intervals of stasis, which are characterized by neutral
              sequence evolution, punctuated by shorter intervals of rapid
              fitness increase when evolutionary change is driven by positive
              selection. These observations have implications for influenza
              surveillance and vaccine formulation; in particular, the
              possibility exists that parallel amino acid replacements could
              serve as a predictor of new dominant strains. REVIEWERS: Ron

              spatiotemporal spread. Such phylodynamic analyses are
              particularly useful to understand the epidemiology of rapidly
              evolving viral pathogens. As the number of genome sequences
              available for different pathogens has increased dramatically over
              the last years, phylodynamic analysis with traditional methods
              becomes challenging as these methods scale poorly with growing
              datasets. Here, we present TreeTime, a Python-based framework for
              phylodynamic analysis using an approximate Maximum Likelihood
              approach. TreeTime can estimate ancestral states, infer evolution
              models, reroot trees to maximize temporal signals, estimate
              molecular clock phylogenies and population size histories. The
              runtime of TreeTime scales linearly with dataset size.",

  abstract = "Large phylogenomics data sets require fast tree inference
              methods, especially for maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenies. Fast
              programs exist, but due to inherent heuristics to find optimal
              trees, it is not clear whether the best tree is found. Thus,
              there is need for additional approaches that employ different
              search strategies to find ML trees and that are at the same time
              as fast as currently available ML programs. We show that a
              combination of hill-climbing approaches and a stochastic
              perturbation method can be time-efficiently implemented. If we
              allow the same CPU time as RAxML and PhyML, then our software
              IQ-TREE found higher likelihoods between 62.2\% and 87.1\% of the
              studied alignments, thus efficiently exploring the tree-space. If
              we use the IQ-TREE stopping rule, RAxML and PhyML are faster in
              75.7\% and 47.1\% of the DNA alignments and 42.2\% and 100\% of
              the protein alignments, respectively. However, the range of
              obtaining higher likelihoods with IQ-TREE improves to
              73.3-97.1\%. IQ-TREE is freely available at

              between antigenic and genetic evolution, significant differences
              were observed: Antigenic evolution was more punctuated than
              genetic evolution, and genetic change sometimes had a
              disproportionately large antigenic effect. The method readily
              allows monitoring of antigenic differences among vaccine and
              circulating strains and thus estimation of the effects of
              vaccination. Further, this approach offers a route to predicting
              the relative success of emerging strains, which could be achieved
              by quantifying the combined effects of population level immune
              escape and viral fitness on strain evolution.",
