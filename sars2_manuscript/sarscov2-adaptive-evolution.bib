	abstract = {Large phylogenomics data sets require fast tree inference
              methods, especially for maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenies. Fast
              programs exist, but due to inherent heuristics to find optimal
              trees, it is not clear whether the best tree is found. Thus,
              there is need for additional approaches that employ different
              search strategies to find ML trees and that are at the same time
              as fast as currently available ML programs. We show that a
              combination of hill-climbing approaches and a stochastic
              perturbation method can be time-efficiently implemented. If we
              allow the same CPU time as RAxML and PhyML, then our software
              IQ-TREE found higher likelihoods between 62.2\% and 87.1\% of the
              studied alignments, thus efficiently exploring the tree-space. If
              we use the IQ-TREE stopping rule, RAxML and PhyML are faster in
              75.7\% and 47.1\% of the DNA alignments and 42.2\% and 100\% of
              the protein alignments, respectively. However, the range of
              obtaining higher likelihoods with IQ-TREE improves to
              73.3-97.1\%. IQ-TREE is freely available at

              quantified and visualized from its introduction into humans in
              1968 to 2003. Although there was remarkable correspondence
              between antigenic and genetic evolution, significant differences
              were observed: Antigenic evolution was more punctuated than

@article{Wolf2006-vy,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The interpandemic evolution of the influenza A virus
              hemagglutinin (HA) protein is commonly considered a paragon of
              rapid evolutionary change under positive selection in which amino
              acid replacements are fixed by virtue of their effect on
              antigenicity, enabling the virus to evade immune surveillance.
              RESULTS: We performed phylogenetic analyses of the recently
              obtained large and relatively unbiased samples of the HA
              sequences from 1995-2005 isolates of the H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes
              of influenza A virus. Unexpectedly, it was found that the
              evolution of H3N2 HA includes long intervals of generally neutral
              sequence evolution without apparent substantial antigenic change
              (``stasis'' periods) that are characterized by an excess of
              synonymous over nonsynonymous substitutions per site, lack of
              association of amino acid replacements with epitope regions, and
              slow extinction of coexisting virus lineages. These long periods
              of stasis are punctuated by shorter intervals of rapid evolution
              under positive selection during which new dominant lineages
              quickly displace previously coexisting ones. The preponderance of
              positive selection during intervals of rapid evolution is
              supported by the dramatic excess of amino acid replacements in
              the epitope regions of HA compared to replacements in the rest of
              the HA molecule. In contrast, the stasis intervals showed a much
              more uniform distribution of replacements over the HA molecule,
              with a statistically significant difference in the rate of
              synonymous over nonsynonymous substitution in the epitope regions
              between the two modes of evolution. A number of parallel amino
              acid replacements - the same amino acid substitution occurring
              independently in different lineages - were also detected in H3N2
              HA. These parallel mutations were, largely, associated with
              periods of rapid fitness change, indicating that there are major
              limitations on evolutionary pathways during antigenic change. The
              finding that stasis is the prevailing modality of H3N2 evolution
              suggests that antigenic changes that lead to an increase in
              fitness typically result from epistatic interactions between
              several amino acid substitutions in the HA and, perhaps, other
              viral proteins. The strains that become dominant due to increased
              fitness emerge from low frequency strains thanks to the last
              amino acid replacement that completes the set of replacements
              required to produce a significant antigenic change; no subset of
              substitutions results in a biologically significant antigenic
              change and corresponding fitness increase. In contrast to H3N2,
              no clear intervals of evolution under positive selection were
              detected for the H1N1 HA during the same time span. Thus, the
              ascendancy of H1N1 in some seasons is, most likely, caused by the
              drop in the relative fitness of the previously prevailing H3N2
              lineages as the fraction of susceptible hosts decreases during
              the stasis intervals. CONCLUSION: We show that the common view of
              the evolution of influenza virus as a rapid, positive
              selection-driven process is, at best, incomplete. Rather, the
              interpandemic evolution of influenza appears to consist of
              extended intervals of stasis, which are characterized by neutral
              sequence evolution, punctuated by shorter intervals of rapid
              fitness increase when evolutionary change is driven by positive
              selection. These observations have implications for influenza
              surveillance and vaccine formulation; in particular, the
              possibility exists that parallel amino acid replacements could
              serve as a predictor of new dominant strains. REVIEWERS: Ron

	abstract = {Influenza viruses undergo continual antigenic evolution allowing
              mutant viruses to evade host immunity acquired to previous virus
              strains. Antigenic phenotype is often assessed through pairwise
              measurement of cross-reactivity between influenza strains using
              the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. Here, we extend
              previous approaches to antigenic cartography, and simultaneously
              characterize antigenic and genetic evolution by modeling the
              diffusion of antigenic phenotype over a shared virus phylogeny.
              Using HI data from influenza lineages A/H3N2, A/H1N1, B/Victoria
              and B/Yamagata, we determine patterns of antigenic drift across
              viral lineages, showing that A/H3N2 evolves faster and in a more
              punctuated fashion than other influenza lineages. We also show
              that year-to-year antigenic drift appears to drive incidence
              patterns within each influenza lineage. This work makes possible
              substantial future advances in investigating the dynamics of
              influenza and other antigenically-variable pathogens by providing
              a model that intimately combines molecular and antigenic

              to the human population, regularly infecting and reinfecting
              humans while typically causing asymptomatic to mild respiratory
              infections. It is not known to what extent reinfection by these
              viruses is due to waning immune memory or antigenic drift of the
              viruses. Here we address the influence of antigenic drift on
              immune evasion of seasonal coronaviruses. We provide evidence

              coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) evolution is paramount to control the

              genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 variants available as of January
              2021. The results show that the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2
              during the pandemic is characterized primarily by purifying
              selection, but a small set of sites appear to evolve under
              positive selection. The receptor-binding domain of the spike
              protein and the region of the nucleocapsid protein associated
              with nuclear localization signals (NLS) are enriched with
              positively selected amino acid replacements. These replacements

              phylogenies that ended in February 2020 was followed by a major
              extinction event and global homogenization concomitant with the
              spread of D614G in the spike protein, ending in March 2020. The
              NLS-associated variants across multiple partitions rose to global
              prominence in March to July, during a period of stasis in terms
              of interregional diversity. Finally, beginning in July 2020,
              multiple mutations, some of which have since been demonstrated to
              enable antibody evasion, began to emerge associated with ongoing
              regional diversification, which might be indicative of
              speciation.},

	abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 is a SARS-like coronavirus of likely zoonotic origin
              first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of
              China's Hubei province. The virus has since spread globally,
              resulting in the currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The first
              whole genome sequence was published on January 5 2020, and
              thousands of genomes have been sequenced since this date. This
              resource allows unprecedented insights into the past demography
              of SARS-CoV-2 but also monitoring of how the virus is adapting to
              its novel human host, providing information to direct drug and
              vaccine design. We curated a dataset of 7666 public genome
              assemblies and analysed the emergence of genomic diversity over
              time. Our results are in line with previous estimates and point
              to all sequences sharing a common ancestor towards the end of
              2019, supporting this as the period when SARS-CoV-2 jumped into
              its human host. Due to extensive transmission, the genetic
              diversity of the virus in several countries recapitulates a large
              fraction of its worldwide genetic diversity. We identify regions
              of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that have remained largely invariant to
              date, and others that have already accumulated diversity. By
              focusing on mutations which have emerged independently multiple
              times (homoplasies), we identify 198 filtered recurrent mutations
              in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Nearly 80\% of the recurrent mutations
              produced non-synonymous changes at the protein level, suggesting
              possible ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2. Three sites in Orf1ab
              in the regions encoding Nsp6, Nsp11, Nsp13, and one in the Spike
              protein are characterised by a particularly large number of
              recurrent mutations (>15 events) which may signpost convergent
              evolution and are of particular interest in the context of
              adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to the human host. We additionally
              provide an interactive user-friendly web-application to query the
              alignment of the 7666 SARS-CoV-2 genomes.},

              globally, infecting more than 150000 people, and being declared
              pandemic by the WHO. We provide here bio-informatic, evolutionary
              analysis of 351 available sequences of its genome with the aim of
              mapping genome structural variations and the patterns of
              selection. METHODS: A Maximum likelihood tree has been built and
              selective pressure has been investigated in order to find any
              mutation developed during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic that could
              potentially affect clinical evolution of the infection. FINDING:
              We have found in more recent isolates the presence of two
              mutations affecting the Non-Structural Protein 6 (NSP6) and the
              Open Reding Frame10 (ORF 10) adjacent regions. Amino acidic
              change stability analysis suggests both mutations could confer
              lower stability of the protein structures. INTERPRETATION: One of
              the two mutations, likely developed within the genome during
              virus spread, could affect virus intracellular survival. Genome
              follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 spread is urgently needed in order to

              concern. In infected cells, the CoV RNA-synthesizing machinery
              associates with modified endoplasmic reticulum membranes that are
              transformed into the viral replication organelle (RO). Although
              double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) appear to be a pan-CoV RO

              nuclear translocation. We identify two sets of viral proteins

              transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)/STAT2
              phosphorylation or nuclear translocation. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2

              replicates to a higher level than chimeric replicons containing
              nsp1 or nsp6 from SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Altogether, the study

               selection has been driven by immunological escape, with these
               changes corresponding to restricted antigenic diversity in the
               virus population. We also show that H1N1/2009 viruses have been
               subject to regular seasonal bottlenecks and a global reduction
               in antigenic and genetic diversity in 2014. Influenza A
               H1N1/2009 virus emerged from swine and rapidly replaced the
               seasonal H1N1 virus. Here, the authors show that natural

               driven by adaptation to the new host but later selection has
               been driven by immunological escape.},

	abstract = {As shown during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, phylogenetic and
              phylodynamic methods are essential tools to study the spread and
              evolution of pathogens. One of the central assumptions of these
              methods is that the shared history of pathogens isolated from
              different hosts can be described by a branching phylogenetic
              tree. Recombination breaks this assumption. This makes it
              problematic to apply phylogenetic methods to study recombining
              pathogens, including, for example, coronaviruses. Here, we
              introduce a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach that allows
              inference of recombination networks from genetic sequence data
              under a template switching model of recombination. Using this
              method, we first show that recombination is extremely common in
              the evolutionary history of SARS-like coronaviruses. We then show
              how recombination rates across the genome of the human seasonal
              coronaviruses 229E, OC43 and NL63 vary with rates of adaptation.
              This suggests that recombination could be beneficial to fitness
              of human seasonal coronaviruses. Additionally, this work sets the
              stage for Bayesian phylogenetic tracking of the spread and
              evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the future, even as recombinant

              by three spike mutations F157L, V367F and Q613H, was first
              identified in COVID-19 cases from a Ugandan prison in July 2020,
              and then was identified in the general population with additional
              spike mutations (R102I, L141F, E484K and P681R) to comprise
              lineage A.23.1 by September 2020-with this virus being designated
              a variant of interest (VOI) in Africa and with subsequent spread
              to 26 other countries. The P681R spike substitution of the A.23.1
              VOI is of note as it increases the number of basic residues in
              the sub-optimal SARS-CoV-2 spike protein furin cleavage site; as
              such, this substitution may affect viral replication,
              transmissibility or pathogenic properties. The same P681R
              substitution has also appeared in B.1.617 variants, including
              B.1.617.2 (Delta). Here, we performed assays using fluorogenic
              peptides mimicking the S1/S2 sequence from A.23.1 and B.1.617.2
              and observed significantly increased cleavability with furin,
              compared to sequences derived from the original Wuhan-Hu1 S1/S2.
              We performed functional infectivity assays using pseudotyped MLV

              increase in transduction for A.23.1-pseudotyped particles
              compared to Wuhan-Hu-1 in Vero-TMPRSS2 and Calu-3 cells (with a
              presumed ``early'' entry pathway), although lowered infection in
              Vero E6 cells (with a presumed ``late'' entry pathway). However,
              these changes in infectivity were not reproduced in the original
              Wuhan-Hu-1 spike bearing only the P681R substitution. Our
              findings suggest that while A.23.1 has increased furin-mediated
              cleavage linked to the P681R substitution-which may affect viral
              infection and transmissibility-this substitution alone is not
              sufficient and needs to occur on the background of other spike

              around the world. The mechanism that drives this global
              replacement has not been defined. Here we report that Delta spike
              mutation P681R plays a key role in the Alpha-to-Delta variant
              replacement. In a replication competition assay, Delta SARS-CoV-2
              efficiently outcompeted the Alpha variant in human lung
              epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues. Delta
              SARS-CoV-2 bearing the Alpha-spike glycoprotein replicated less
              efficiently than the wild-type Delta variant, suggesting the
              importance of Delta spike in enhancing viral replication. The
              Delta spike has accumulated mutation P681R located at a furin
              cleavage site that separates the spike 1 (S1) and S2 subunits.
              Reverting the P681R mutation to wild-type P681 significantly
              reduced the replication of Delta variant, to a level lower than
              the Alpha variant. Mechanistically, the Delta P681R mutation
              enhanced the cleavage of the full-length spike to S1 and S2,
              leading to increased infection via cell surface entry. In
              contrast, the Alpha spike also has a mutation at the same amino
              acid (P681H), but the spike cleavage from purified Alpha virions
              was reduced compared to the Delta spike. Collectively, our
              results indicate P681R as a key mutation in enhancing Delta
              variant replication via increased S1/S2 cleavage. Spike mutations

	abstract = {Summary The pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 threatens public
              health worldwide. The viral spike protein mediates SARS-CoV-2
              entry into host cells and harbors a S1/S2 cleavage site
              containing multiple arginine residues (multibasic) not found in
              closely related animal coronaviruses. However, the role of this
              multibasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown.
              Here, we report that the cellular protease furin cleaves the
              spike protein at the S1/S2 site and that cleavage is essential
              for S-protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and entry into human lung
              cells. Moreover, optimizing the S1/S2 site increased cell-cell,
              but not virus-cell, fusion, suggesting that the corresponding
              viral variants might exhibit increased cell-cell spread and
              potentially altered virulence. Our results suggest that
              acquisition of a S1/S2 multibasic cleavage site was essential for
              SARS-CoV-2 infection of humans and identify furin as a potential
